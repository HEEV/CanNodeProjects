This project is meant to be used on conjunction with a Wii nunchuck and a spi LED ring. In addition
to see the output of the nunchuck you need to be able to read CAN messages that are output from the
microncontroller board. Full source code is availible at 
[github]<https://github.com/HEEV/spi-i2c-project>. Code for the LED driver part of the project is 
in the led-testing branch. Code for the nunchuck is in the wiiRemote branch.
